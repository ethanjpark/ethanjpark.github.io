      This is my ongoing MSR winter quarter project. I will be using the plume simulation feature in the <a href="https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">UUV Simulator</a> to implement various plume detection algorithms and methods. UUV Simulator was developed in the scope of the EU ECSEL project 662107 SWARMS for unmanned underwater vehicle simulation based on Gazebo and ROS by <a href="https://github.com/musamarcusso" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">Musa Morena Marcusso Manhaes</a>. Since its beginnings in 2016 it seems to have gained significant traction in the maritime ROS and robotics community, especially in Europe. It was a topic of discussion at underwater ROS workshops such as <a href="https://discourse.ros.org/t/bts-2018-workshop-adoption-of-conventions-in-the-underwater-ros-community/5389" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">BTS 2018</a> and a underwater ROS workshop <a href="https://discourse.ros.org/t/underwater-ros-workshop-woods-hole-oceanographic-institution/5197" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>.
      <br><br>
      With this project I aim to familiarize myself with a potentially useful tool for future work and study in the field of underwater robots. Furthermore, I hope to continue to learn about the unique challenges that face robots in underwater environments through implementation of plume detection, a very common application of underwater robots in both commercial and scientific uses.
