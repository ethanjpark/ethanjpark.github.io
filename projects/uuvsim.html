      Plume Tracing in UUV Simulator<br>

      This is my ongoing MSR winter quarter project. I will be using the plume simulation feature in the <a href="https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">UUV Simulator</a> to implement various plume detection algorithms and methods. UUV Simulator was developed in the scope of the EU ECSEL project 662107 SWARMS for unmanned underwater vehicle simulation based on Gazebo and ROS by <a href="https://github.com/musamarcusso" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">Musa Morena Marcusso Manhaes</a>. Since its beginnings in 2016 it seems to have gained significant traction in the maritime ROS and robotics community, especially in Europe. It was a topic of discussion at underwater ROS workshops such as <a href="https://discourse.ros.org/t/bts-2018-workshop-adoption-of-conventions-in-the-underwater-ros-community/5389" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">BTS 2018</a> and a underwater ROS workshop <a href="https://discourse.ros.org/t/underwater-ros-workshop-woods-hole-oceanographic-institution/5197" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>.
      <br><br>
      With this project I aim to familiarize myself with a potentially useful tool for future work and study in the field of underwater robots. Furthermore, I hope to continue to learn about the unique challenges that face robots in underwater environments through implementation of plume detection, a very common application of underwater robots in both commercial and scientific uses.

        One large concern that I had had before going in was the simulator's compatibility with ROS Melodic, as all documentation and discussion seemed to assume use with Kinetic. If the simulator didn't work with Melodic, this problem could have potentially derailed the entire project. Fortunately, this did not come to pass and there were no issues stemming from ROS itself.
        <br><br>
        However, I did find that the simulator assumed the installation of a few packages and libraries that my ROS environment did not have. These were: <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/message_to_tf" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">message_to_tf</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/geographic_msgs" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">geographic_msgs</a>, <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io" style="color: #00ccff" target="_blank">GeographicLib</a>. I assume that this assumption was due to how commonly used these packages are in other ROS packages - meaning that the authors would have had them installed for other purposes and therefore forgotten to document these dependencies.

        First order of business once the simulator ran without errors was to ensure that all the components that I would need for the final test (plume tracing) worked. I started with moving the robot, which is done by giving the robot a list of waypoints to follow. The resulting simulation in RViz is shown above. 
        <br><br>
        Once this was successfully tested I moved onto the plume simulator. Looking at the launch files, it seems that there is an option to simulate the plume in Gazebo, however for the moment all work was done in RViz. I played around with different currents, the results of which can be seen below (vertical current on left, normal current on right). <a style="color: #00ccff">[Updated 2/11/2019]</a>
