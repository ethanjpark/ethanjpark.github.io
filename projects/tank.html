        I found this beauty while digging through some old files, it's an RC tank that I made from scratch during my internship at ROBOTIS, in Seoul. It's probably hard to tell, but I used the M4 Sherman as inspiration.

        Below and on the left is the ROBOTIS CM9, the microcontroller that I used. On the right is a mid-construction photo of the chassis. I later did away with the side skirts for ease of access to the internals.

      The tank itself is made from a smattering of spare parts and pieces from ROBOTIS' line of hobbyist kits and toys. Locomotion is through two Dynamixel actuators (Probably AX-12As, which I used for the <a href="./rccar.html" style="color: #00ccff">RC car</a>), one for each tread. Each tread could be actuated independently. I also used one for turret rotation (in place beneath the gray wheel piece, or the turret ring as I liked to imagine it), and another inside the turret to elevate and depress the 'cannon'.
      <br><br>
      Code for the CM9 was written in C in a proprietary IDE, similar to for an Arduino. Using a bluetooth dongle and an Android app, I could control the tank with keyboard presses from my phone. Below are some videos for your entertainment, in glorious 360p straight from 2013.
