    I am a native Korean, having immigrated to the States with my family as a child. Since then, I have lived in various locations within the Midwest. I grew up playing many different sports, taking a liking to tennis and baseball in particular. I am also fortunate enough to be somewhat well-traveled, having visited places such as Amsterdam, Egypt, and most recently, Iceland. <br/> <br/>

    However, it is technology that has been my constant companion through all these years. One of my earliest memories is playing the classic Rollercoaster Tycoon on the ancient family CRT running Windows 2000 (or was it 95?). It was this curiosity and love for technology that led me to study computer science for my undergrad at Northwestern, join the solar car team, and pursue grad school.

    I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Robotics program at
    Northwestern, where I hope to gain a more holistic understanding of all
    things robotics, especially in its software applications. <br/> <br/>
